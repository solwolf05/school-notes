### Kinetic Theory

Matter is made of moving particles. The distance between particles is inversely correlated with the force between them (potential energy). Temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles. Collisions between particles are elastic (no energy is lost).

Kinetic energy ($E_{k}$) = Energy from the overall motion of an object as a whole.  
Thermal energy ($E_{thermal}$) = energy from the microscopic motion of particles.  
Internal energy ($U$) = Total microscopic energy stored in a system (thermal + chemical + electric, etc).

$$
E_{k} = \frac{3}{2}kT
$$

$k =$  Boltzmann's constant $= 1.38 \times 10^{-23} JK^{-1}$  
$T$ = Temperature (Kelvin)

$$
E_{k} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

$m$ = Mass
$v$ = Volume

Heat is the energy that is transferred between objects. More heat = more temperature.

$$
Q = mc\Delta T
$$

$Q$ = Thermal energy (Joules)  
$m$ = Mass (Kg)  
$c$ = Specific heat capacity ($J{Kg}^{-1}K^{-1}$)  
$T$ = Temperature (Kelvin)

Specific heat capacity is the heat required to raise the temperature of 1 Kg of a substance by 1 Kelvin.

0th Law of Thermodynamics = Heat is transferred between objects in contact until they reach thermal equilibrium (no net heat transfer (same temperature)).

### Calorimetry

The science of measuring the amount of heat transferred between objects. The heat transfers from the hotter object to the colder one.

### Specific Latent Heat

Specific latent heat is the heat required to change 1 Kg of a substance from one state to another. When a substance reaches its melting point, the heat energy applied stops increasing the kinetic energy of the particles and instead pulls apart the bonds between them. The same happens for when a substance vaporises,

Formulas:

Fusion (melting) = $Q = mLf$  
Vaporisation = $Q = mLv$
